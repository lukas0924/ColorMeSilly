            Why is Color Theory Important?
            </p></div>
        <div class="p3"><p1>
            Color theory is both the science and art of using color. It explains how humans perceive color, and how colors mix, match, or 
            contrast with each other. Color theory also conveys 
            the ways in which colors interact with each other in the natural world, 
            as well as how to create certain colors through the addition or subtraction of color. The foundation of color theory, which is where this games focal point lies, 
            is comprised of a breakdown of colors into specific categories: primary, secondary, and tertiary colors. For clarity, there are more colors than just primary, secondary, and tertiary colors, but the colors within these three categories are
             where most of the common colors we encounter in our daily lives fall into. This game explores the additive side of color theory with the utilization of the RBG color wheel.
