            This Game Mode is meant to establish the fundamentals of color theory by teaching the primary, secondary, and tertiary colors.
            To play this game mode, the process is simple. For each game screen, color specific boxes will appear alongside a scorebox. 
            To increase score, click on the color boxes that complete the prompt given. For example, the first level will ask the player to select all primary colors.
            Once all are selected, the player will proceed to the subsequent level and repeat the process. This game mode will aid in color identification, which will make playing our color combination game mode easier.

           This Game Mode expands upon the color identification mechanic within the color matching game mode. This mode tasks the player to begin with RBG primary colors and combine them successfully until they have created tertiary colors. This mode aims to help students understand the framework of how colors interact with world around them.
           Increased color theory comprehension will carry over to an individuals creativity within the arts.
