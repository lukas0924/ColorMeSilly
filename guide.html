            This Game Mode is meant to establish the fundamentals of color theory by teaching the primary, secondary, and tertiary colors.
            To play this game mode, the process is simple. For each game screen, color specific boxes will appear alongside a scorebox. 
            To increase score, click on the color boxes that complete the prompt given. For example, the first level will ask the player to select all primary colors.
            Once all are selected, the player will proceed to the subsequent level and repeat the process. This game mode will aid in color identification, which will make playing our color combination game mode easier.
